## how it works? 

## **Step 1: Create Your First Travel Log**


<br>
Start by navigating to the right-side panel and click either the "Individual" or "Group" button: 
<br>
<br>

### Add travel <br>

Here you can create a simple log for short/individual travels. (country to country / city to city)
The travel creator is divided on 3 sections:
- Basic data: give your travel a unique name, select the date when your journey took place. For instance, "Spain - Madrid" | 05.09.2023 - 07.09.2023".
- Settings: Choose a country highlight color and opacity, width, color and type of polyline that connects 2 or more markers related to the travel log.
- Travel type: Here you can pick 1 of 8 travel types that you used during your travel.

Now you can start placing a path on the map.
Once you've finished, just hit the "✔️" button to confirm creating your travel log.

And there we go, you created your first travel log!

### Group <br>

Here you can create a whole group for much bigger travels, that includes multiple travel logs, spanning across multiple days or countries.
- The process is similar, begin with naming your group and set a date. For instance, "Europe Tour 2023 | 10.09.2023 - 20.09.2023". <br />
- Hit the "✔️" button to confirm your choice.

## **Step 2: Add Sub Travels to Your Group**

For any present group, you can create sub-travel logs using the ➕ button in the group container we've created before.
The process is exactly the same as creating non-grouped travel logs (Step: 1), but this time, all the logs you have created will find its way inside this group and will be related to it.

## **Step 3: Manage travel logs**

In the same panel, you can manage your logs:

1a / 1b) Rename the group or travel log. <br>
2) Add sub-travels (we have that covered). <br>
3a / 3b) Delete the group or travel log. <br>
4) Collapse button: if your travel log is getting too big, you can simply hide the display of this particular log. <br>
